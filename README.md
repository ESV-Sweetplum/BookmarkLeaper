## Features:

- New bookmarks are automatically added to the list of bookmarks.
- Bookmarks below the map are automatically ignored.
- Text truncation ensures long bookmarks do not break the plugin.
- Search for specific bookmarks, or enter a filter string to exclude certain terms from your search.

## Installation:

- [Go to the latest releases](github.com/ESV-Sweetplum/BookmarkLeaper/releases/latest) and download it by clicking on `BookmarkLeaper.zip`.
- The zip folder will contain a folder with the same name. Drop this folder into your `Quaver/Plugins` directory.
